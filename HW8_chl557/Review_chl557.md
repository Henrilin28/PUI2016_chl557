## Review

**CLARITY:** 
The plot is very clear to read and you use trangle to identify each point


**ESTHETIC:** 
I think the color is very readable. I engjoy light blue

**HONESTY:** 
The plot did visaulize the injuries per year but it is a little bit hard to tell the insight and the motivation of this plot.
