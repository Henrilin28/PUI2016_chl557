## Review

**CLARITY:** 
The plot has too many information to read. It is better to transform this time series lines in different format.

**ESTHETIC:** 
There are similar colors to represent the lines. For such a reason, it will be hard to identify the right line.

**HONESTY:** 
The plot did visaulize complicated information but it is hard to describe the result
