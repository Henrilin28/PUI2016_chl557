## Citibike Review 
### Zhaohong Niu -> Henry Lin

### a. Verify formatting of Null and Alternative Hypotheses
The idea is "Customer are less likely than Subscripter to commute by bike" 

Origin NULL HYPOTHESIS was: 
The ratio of Subscripter biking on week days to Subscripter biking on weekends is the same or higher than the ratio of Customer biking on week days to woman biking on weekends

Should be "The ratio of Subscripter biking on week days to Subscripter biking on weekends is the #same or smaller# than the ratio of Customer biking on week days to Customer biking on weekends." 

Also, if we are examing total usage of Subscripter and Customer bikers, the difference between weekday/weekend should be controlled or ignored. Suggest to change into days. 

### b. Verify that the data supports the project
The data supports the project is legit and has the appropriate features to answer the question. 

### c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked.
I recommend t-Test to looks at difference between two groups (subscripter/customer).
