This Homework I tried two modules here:

1. plotly and Seaborn
- Social_listening_Henry.ipynb
Data is based on a crawled dataset from web. It described topic transition before and after Taiwan president election. However, plotly plot can not be rendered by github but seaborn shown the kde plot and time series plot of it.

2. bokeh
- Visualization Fun.ipynb
- Bokeh_Implementation.ipynb
Bokeh is very similar to R shiny, which required server to render the ipython notebook. Therefore it is not rendered.
