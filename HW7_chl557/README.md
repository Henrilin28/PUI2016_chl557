This Homework I tried two modules here:

1. plotly
- Social_listening_Henry.ipynb
Data is based on a crawled dataset from web. It described topic transition before and after Taiwan president election.

2. bokeh
- Visualization Fun.ipynb
- Bokeh_Implementation.ipynb
Bokeh is very similar to R shiny, which required server to render the ipython notebook. Therefore it is not rendered.
