The question and Null hypothesis are well formulated, but of course extremely similar to what I had done. So much in fact that you literally copied and pasted by null, and forgot to replace "women" with "customer". Your notebook reads "The ratio of Subscripter biking on week days to Subscripter biking on weekends is the same or lower than the ratio of Customer biking on week days **to woman** biking on weekends [modified based on @EstherNiu's observation].

The rest of the notebook is nearly identical to what my notebooks was. 
I think you could have done better and learned more if you worked on something slightly more different, or even on the same question but without following my work step by step. 

**Also I had asked to remove the tests, so that the reviewer could independently suggest a test.**
