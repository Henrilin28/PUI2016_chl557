# PUI2016 HW 8 for Thursday session, HW9 for Tuesday session. 
## But please name your directory HW9_\<netID>

# November 10 2016. Diversity is considered a resource that enriches us culturally and intellectually in this class. No instances of harassment or attempt to marginalize students will be tolerated in my class. If you have concerns please come talk to me

# IMPORTANT NOTE: from this homework on you are graded on [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliance as well!
Use https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2016_fb55/blob/master/PEP8MinimalRequirements.md as a guideline.


## ASSIGNED READING:

1. I already assigned this, but once again, now that you have written a lot of notebooks. This is how you write a notebook integrating critical thinking and inference with code:

Reading: an excellent analysis of time series

2. Technical reading on statsmodels time analysis tools. Get through ARMA (first part) to get an idea of how such a document would be written, and of how to choose the model parameters for ARMA and ARIMA models.

# Submission Info:


For Assignment 1 (and only): work in groups as usal, and you are encouraged to work in groups. Create a HW9_<nyuID> directory in your PUI2016_<nyuID> repository. Include a README.md that briefly summarizes the scope of the homework (so we know you understand what you did), and states with whome you worked and what you specifically contributed to.

Submit Assignment 1 as a notebook. **Please dont just download my notebook, leave instructions in and fill in code cells: make it a presentation, comment on what you see, in English, with full sentences, and use critical thinking!!** 

Keep in mind that we will look for possible cases of plagiarism, and if the code appears too similar to that of people that you did not work with to be original work (there are automated ways to look for plagiarism in code) you will be penalized.
